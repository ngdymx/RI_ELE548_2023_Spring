\subsection{Background of SHiP}
Signature-based hit predictor(SHiP) is a method used in high-performance caching systems to predict cache hits based on signatures of memory access patterns. In this approach, the cache is divided into multiple signature-based prediction modules, each responsible for a subset of memory accesses. The signature module creates a signature for each memory access and stores it in the cache. The hit predictor then uses these signatures to predict future cache hits, based on a match between the current memory access signature and the stored signatures. This method allows for faster cache hit detection and reduced access latencies, as the hit predictor can quickly retrieve data from the cache without accessing the main memory\cite{llc}. Signature-based hit predictor is particularly useful in large-scale computing systems that require high-performance caching to handle large amounts of data and reduce access latencies. It is also a popular method for multi-core and multi-processor systems, as it allows for efficient and scalable cache management across multiple computing nodes\cite{Jinchun,Elvira}.

 The history of signature-based hit predictor dates back to the early 1990s, when researchers began exploring ways to improve the performance of computer memory systems. The first signature-based hit predictor was introduced in a paper published by IBM researchers in 1993. This system used a signature-based approach to predict cache hits, in which a small signature was generated for each memory access and used to predict future access patterns. This system was able to achieve significant improvements in cache performance and reduced access latencies, making it a popular technology in high-performance computing systems.\cite{Samira} Over the next few years, researchers continued to refine the signature-based hit predictor technology, developing new algorithms and techniques for improving prediction accuracy and reducing latency. One of the key advances during this time was the introduction of the two-level signature-based hit predictor, which incorporated two levels of signature generation and prediction to improve the accuracy of cache hit predictions. In the early 2000s, researchers began exploring the use of machine learning techniques in signature-based hit predictor systems. These techniques used statistical models and pattern recognition algorithms to learn and predict access patterns based on historical data, improving the accuracy of cache hit predictions even further. In recent years, researchers have continued to refine and improve signature-based hit predictor systems, incorporating new features and parameters to optimize performance in modern multi-core and multi-processor systems. These include processor affinity tracking, access history and frequency tracking, and other parameters specific to parallel computing architectures. Today, signature-based hit predictor is widely used in high-performance computing systems, including supercomputers, data centers, and cloud computing environments.\cite{Wu2011} It is an important technology for improving the performance and efficiency of modern computing systems and is likely to remain an area of active research and development in the coming years.

\subsection{Background of SHiP++}
Signature-based hit predictor++ is an advanced method for predicting cache hits that builds upon the traditional signature-based hit predictor method used in high-performance caching systems.\cite{San,arka} This method is designed to improve cache efficiency and performance in multi-core and multi-processor systems by predicting cache hits based on multiple parameters and features.\cite{Samira} The basic idea behind signature-based hit predictor++ is to divide the cache into multiple prediction modules, each responsible for a subset of memory accesses.\cite{ADueling} Each module generates a signature for each memory access and stores it in the cache. The hit predictor++ then uses these signatures to predict future cache hits, based on a match between the current memory access signature and the stored signatures. However, unlike traditional signature-based hit predictor, which uses only the memory access pattern to predict cache hits, signature-based hit predictor++ incorporates additional features and parameters to improve the accuracy of predictions\cite{Belady}.\par

One of the key features of SHiP++ is its ability to predict cache hits based on processor affinity \cite{Evan}. In multi-core and multi-processor systems, different processors or cores may have different access patterns and may be more likely to access certain areas of memory than others. Signature-based hit predictor++ takes this into account by tracking the processor affinity of each memory access and using this information to predict cache hits. This improves the accuracy of predictions and helps to reduce access latencies. Another important feature of signature-based hit predictor++ is its ability to predict cache hits based on access history and frequency. By tracking the history of memory accesses and the frequency of access to different areas of memory, signature-based hit predictor++ can make more accurate predictions about which data is likely to be accessed in the future. This feature is particularly useful in multi-core and multi-processor systems, where multiple processors may be accessing the same areas of memory at different times. In addition to these features, signature-based hit predictor++ also incorporates other parameters and features that are specific to multi-core and multi-processor systems, such as cache partitioning, interconnect bandwidth, and cache coherence protocols. These parameters are used to optimize cache performance and reduce access latencies, particularly in systems with high levels of parallelism and complex memory access patterns.\par

SHiP++ is particularly useful in modern computing systems that require high-performance caching to handle large amounts of data and reduce access latency. It is commonly used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications, where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly and efficiently. The method is also useful in cloud computing environments, where multiple users may be accessing the same areas of memory at different times.\par

SHiP++ represents a significant improvement over traditional signature-based hit predictor methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to modern computing systems\cite{Young2017}. By incorporating features such as processor affinity, access history and frequency, and other parameters specific to multi-core and multi-processor systems, signature-based hit predictor++ improves cache performance and reduces access latency. Signature-based hit predictor++ is an important technology for improving the performance and efficiency of modern computing systems and is likely to remain an area of active research and development in the coming years~\cite{Dong}.\par
Both SHIP and SHIP++ can potentially make use of the signature-based hit predictor method for high-performance caching, as this method is well-suited for ship-based computing systems.\cite{Haiming} In a SHIP-based system, the signature-based hit predictor can be used to predict cache hits based on memory access patterns across multiple processors or computing nodes. This allows for improved cache efficiency and reduced access latencies, which is particularly important in large-scale computing systems that require high-performance caching.\cite{Robust,Santosh,Song} Similarly, in a SHIP++ system, the signature-based hit predictor can be used to improve cache efficiency and performance across multiple processors and cores.\cite{wecon} Therefore, the signature-based hit predictor method can be used in both SHIP and SHIP++ systems to optimize cache performance and improve overall system efficiency.

\subsection{Introduction of SHCT}
SHCT, or Signature-based Hit Predictor++ Counter Table, is an important addition to the Signature-based Hit Predictor++ technology. It is a table that is used to store the access frequency of different memory locations and is used in conjunction with the signature-based hit predictor algorithm to improve cache performance and reduce memory access latencies.

The SHCT table is similar to a frequency counter table and stores the access frequency of different memory locations. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific memory location and is incremented each time that location is accessed. The table is organized in such a way that it is easy to update and access, making it an efficient way to track the frequency of memory accesses.\cite{Jiang} The SHCT table is particularly useful in multi-core and multi-processor systems where different processors may have different access patterns and may be more likely to access certain areas of memory than others. By tracking the access frequency of different memory locations, the SHCT table allows the signature-based hit predictor algorithm to make more accurate predictions about which data is likely to be accessed in the future. This, in turn, improves the efficiency of the cache system and reduces memory access latencies.

The addition of the SHCT table to the Signature-based Hit Predictor++ technology represents an important step forward in cache performance optimization. By incorporating this feature, Signature-based Hit Predictor++ is able to make more accurate predictions about future memory accesses, leading to faster and more efficient cache performance. The SHCT table is now a standard feature in many high-performance computing systems and is likely to remain an important area of research and development in the years to come.

\subsection{Introduction of RRPV}
RRPV, or Re-reference Prediction Value, is another key feature in the Ship++ technology. It is a component of the Re-Reference Prediction Table (RRPT) and is used to track the re-reference behavior of memory locations in order to improve cache performance.\cite{Liu}

The RRPV value is a 2-bit saturating counter that is associated with each entry in the RRPT. It is used to track the history of re-references to a memory location and to predict future re-references. Specifically, the RRPV value stores a sequence of 2-bit saturating counters, with each counter representing a different time interval between re-references. When a memory location is accessed, the corresponding counter is incremented, and the RRPV value is updated accordingly.\cite{doi}The RRPV value is used in conjunction with the RRPU module and the RRPT table to make predictions about future memory access patterns. When a memory location is accessed, the RRPU module consults the RRPT table to determine its re-reference history and uses the RRPV value to predict when the location will be re-referenced. If the prediction indicates that the location will be re-referenced soon, the RRPU module will proactively store the location in the cache to improve performance.\cite{C2010} The RRPV value is a critical component of the Ship++ technology and has been shown to significantly improve cache performance in a wide range of applications. By tracking the re-reference behavior of memory locations and making accurate predictions about future re-references, Ship++ is able to optimize cache performance and reduce memory access latencies, leading to faster and more efficient computing.\cite{llc}

\subsection{Introduction of RRIP}
RRIP, or Re-Reference Interval Prediction, is another important component of the Ship++ technology. It is a replacement policy that is used to select cache lines for eviction when the cache is full.\cite{Onur,kill}

RRIP is based on the idea of predicting the re-reference interval of a cache line, or the time between consecutive accesses to the same memory location. It works by assigning a 3-bit counter value to each cache line, with the counter indicating the number of times the line has been accessed.\cite{santh2007,San} When a cache line is accessed, its counter is set to a maximum value of 7, and the counters of all other lines are decremented by 1. When a cache line needs to be evicted, the RRIP replacement policy selects the line with the highest counter value that has not been accessed in a predetermined number of cycles, known as the re-reference interval.\cite{Wu2011} The re-reference interval is predicted based on the value of the counter, with higher counter values indicating shorter re-reference intervals. The RRIP replacement policy is designed to balance the need for recency of access with the benefit of retaining frequently accessed lines in the cache.\cite{Aamer2010,Sigarch2009} By predicting the re-reference interval of cache lines, RRIP is able to make more intelligent eviction decisions, improving cache hit rates and overall performance.\cite{Seshadri2015}

In Ship++, RRIP is used in conjunction with the SHCT and Signature-based Hit Predictor++ technologies to further improve cache performance. Together, these components work to optimize cache line selection, eviction, and placement, reducing memory access latencies and improving overall system performance.\cite{C2010}
