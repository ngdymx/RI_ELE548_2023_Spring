\section{Introduction}
In the ever-evolving world of computer architecture, cache serves as an essential intermediary storage tier within the memory hierarchy of contemporary computer architectures. Its primary function is to bridge the significant speed disparity between high-performance processors and main memory. The prevalent utilization of chip multiprocessors with shared last-level caches (LLCs) and the growing divergence between the processor and memory speeds further underscores the necessity for high-performing LLCs in modern computing systems\cite{Wu2011}. Recent research findings indicate that the widely-adopted Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy possesses considerable potential for performance enhancement. Consequently, a substantial corpus of scholarly investigations has concentrated on refining last-level cache (LLC) replacement techniques to further optimize system performance\cite{Gao2010,Seznec2010}. This manuscript emphasizes the enhancement of cache performance through the integration of the Signature History Counter Table (SHCT) and bypass methodologies, thereby striving to achieve a more efficient cache management system.\par
The Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policy is a widely adopted and well-established technique in computer architecture. The origins of LRU can be traced back to the early days of cache memory implementation in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, it has become a fundamental cache management policy due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The LRU algorithm operates on the premise that the least recently accessed data is less likely to be required in the near future. In other words, when a cache replacement becomes necessary, the LRU policy selects the cache block that has not been accessed for the longest time to be evicted. To achieve this, LRU maintains a record of the access history of the cache blocks, typically by updating a timestamp or rearranging a list of blocks according to their usage. The LRU cache replacement policy is straightforward to understand and implement. Simultaneously, it can adapt to varying access patterns, as it inherently takes into account the recent history of cache block usage. In many cases, LRU delivers satisfactory cache hit rates, resulting in efficient system performance. However, its disadvantage is obvious, it solely relies on past access patterns and does not consider any potential future access patterns, which can sometimes result in suboptimal cache block replacement decisions. Concurrently, maintaining access history for cache blocks may require additional data structures and processing, increasing the overhead of cache management. Furthermore, in scenarios with unique access patterns, such as cyclic or large working sets, the LRU policy may not perform as efficiently as other specialized replacement policies\cite{Gao2010,Seznec2010,Khan2010,Daniel2010,Kharbutli2008,Qureshi2007,santh2007,C2010,Sigarch2009}.\par
The Signature-based Hit Predictor (SHIP) cache replacement policy is an advanced technique introduced by A. Jaleel et al\cite{Seznec2010}. SHIP aims to address some of the limitations of traditional cache replacement policies, such as the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, by employing a more sophisticated approach to cache management. SHIP operates by predicting the re-reference interval of a cache block, which is the number of accesses between two consecutive accesses of the same block. The re-reference interval is used to determine the eviction priority of cache blocks. SHIP utilizes a data structure called the Signature History Counter Table (SHCT) to store the history of re-reference intervals for each cache block, indexed by a signature derived from the block's address. When a cache block is accessed, SHIP computes its signature and updates the corresponding SHCT entry. The re-reference interval prediction is then employed to assign a Recency Position (RP) value to the cache block. Cache blocks with higher RP values are considered less likely to be accessed in the near future and are prioritized for eviction. It can improve the cache hit rate by predicting the re-reference interval. SHIP can better anticipate future access patterns, leading to higher cache hit rates compared to traditional policies like LRU. Coincident, SHIP can adapt to various access patterns by dynamically updating the re-reference interval predictions based on observed behavior. The SHIP algorithm is designed to work effectively with different cache sizes and associativities, making it a versatile solution for diverse system configurations. However, the SHIP cache replacement policy also has certain disadvantages, like the prediction mechanism and SHCT management in SHIP add complexity to the cache management process compared to simpler policies like LRU. Maintaining the SHCT and implementing the re-reference interval prediction mechanism require additional memory and processing resources, which could potentially offset the performance benefits. While SHIP aims to predict future access patterns, it is not infallible, and prediction errors may lead to suboptimal cache block replacement decisions.\cite{Wu2011}\par
